    Note right of browser: The browser adds new element to the list through JavaScript and sends AJAX request to server with new element in request body.

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    Note: Server gets the new element from AJAX request and saves the element. Sever then returns the 201 (Created) response back to browser.
